In this app (Currency Converter in JavaScript), you can enter your amount and convert your currency to a different country’s currency. 
You can’t leave the amount field blank or enter 0 as an amount. If you do it, then “1” will be filled automatically in the amount field.

You can also easily exchange or reverse the two countries’ currency by clicking on the exchange icon.
